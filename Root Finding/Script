function [A] = specialMatrix(n,m)
% This function should return a matrix A as described in the problem statement
% Inputs n is the number of rows, and m the number of columns
% It is recomended to first create the matrxix A of the correct size, filling it with zeros to start with is not a bad choice
A = zeros(n,m);
A(1,:) = [1:m];
A(:,1) = [1:n];

if nargin == 2
    for i = 2:n
        for k = 2:m
            A(i,k) = A(i-1,k)+A(i,k-1);
        end                     
    end
else
    error('error')
% Now the real challenge is to fill in the correct values of A

% Things beyond here are outside of your function

% Here is a test call of your fuction. Feel free to play around with testing in here and change anything you like
% The grading tests are not impacted by code in this section, and may test different cases than are given in the example here.
%   If you want to use this in matlab directly (i.e. not online), you must save your function as a file specialMatrix.m
%   and then can save this script as anything you like, say specialMatrixTest.m for example.
