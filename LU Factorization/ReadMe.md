# LU Factorization Algorithm
## Created By: Gerard Garcia
### Goal:
Develop a MATLAB function that determines the LU Factorization of a square matrix. Your algorithm must use partial pivoting. Remember, a correctly solved LU factorization solves for the problem P*A = L*U, which is a good check to make sure your solution is correct.
For full credit, you must include appropriate error checking.
### Inputs:
- A = coefficient matrix
### Outputs:
- L = lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals
- U = upper triangular matrix
- P = the pivot matrix
### Limitations:
- Function can only solve square coefficient matrices
